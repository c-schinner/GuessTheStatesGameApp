# Guess the States Game App
The Guess the States Game App is a simple interactive Python program that allows users to guess the names of various states in the United States. 

The app utilizes the Turtle graphics library for visual display and the Pandas library for data management. 

The objective of the game is to correctly guess all 50 states in the U.S.

# Features
Displays a blank map of the United States.

Prompts the user to guess the names of U.S. states.

Tracks and displays the user's progress by showing the number of states guessed correctly out of 50.

Provides the option to exit the game at any time.

Saves a list of states that the user has not yet guessed to a CSV file for further learning.

# Getting Started
Python 3.x

Turtle graphics library

Pandas library

# Installation
Download the 'main.py' file, and all of the subfiles for this project.

Install the required libraries using the following commands:

pip install pandas

# Usage
1. Clone or download the repository containing your game files.

2. Place the blank_states_img.gif and 50_states.csv files in the same directory as your script.

3. Run the Python script using a terminal or IDE.

4. The game window will appear, displaying a blank map of the United States and prompting you to guess state names.

5. Enter the name of a U.S. state and press Enter.

6. If your guess is correct, the state's name will be displayed on the map, and your progress will be shown in the window title.

7. Repeat the process until you have guessed all 50 states or choose to exit by typing "Exit" when prompted for a state name.

8. If you exit the game, a CSV file named states_to_learn.csv will be created, containing the names of states that you have not guessed correctly. This file can be used for further practice.
